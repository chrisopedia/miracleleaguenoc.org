<h1>Let's Play Some Ball!</h1>
<p>The Miracle League of North Orange County is based out of Fullerton, <abbr title="California">CA</abbr> and is geared to those who want to play the great game of baseball. We are a nationwide non-profit organization that gives intellectually and physically disabled children and adults the opportunity to play the great game of baseball. Our players will learn the basic fundamentals of baseball on a traditional baseball diamond. We welcome players who are 8 years old and up. There is no age limit and no player will be turned away because of lack of experience, disability or ability to pay. We use soft-core baseballs and will provide Buddy Assistance if needed.</p>
