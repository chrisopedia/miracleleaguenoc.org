summary:
  - The Miracle League of North Orange County is based out of Fullerton, California and is geared to those who want to play the great game of baseball. We are a nationwide non-profit organization that gives intellectually and physically disabled children and adults the opportunity to play the great game of baseball.
  - Our players will learn the basic fundamentals of baseball on a traditional baseball diamond. We welcome players who are 8 years old and up. There is no age limit and no player will be turned away because of lack of experience, disability or ability to pay. We use soft-core baseballs and will provide Buddy Assistance if needed.
